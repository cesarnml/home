I took the day off from coding.

Last week I managed 4-gym days. Not quite the 6 days I was aiming for, but pretty okay for first week back at the gym.

I still need to finish to parts of the helsinki python course, but I have plenty of time before the exam and with any luck, I'll have it done by Friday.
